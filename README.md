Summary of Secure Multi-Party Computation (Secure Multiparty Computation by YEHUDA LINDELL)

Description :

The basis for this summary is the evolution of Secure Multipart
Computation (MPC) from a theoretically based study to a cryptographic technology
after being studied for more than three decades and proving a solid theoretical
foundation. MPC has been utilised in commercial products because it proved to be
effective enough for usage in practice over the last few years. Supplying security and
privacy, particularly for data dispersed across vast, distant networks, is difficult.
Secure Multipart Computation is one method that offers a solution to the issue of
data security and privacy. This essay will summarise MPC's functions, problems,
and position in the technological chain.

Keywords. Secure multiparty computation (with the acronym MPC, and
sometimes SMPC), Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSSs).

Behind the Scenes :
 This Topic was part of the coursework  assigned to me by the lecturer of Crtical Systems Engineering (CS5032) and my job was to create a summary based on my understanding of the paper. At the first glance , It was just gibberish and pretty confusing to me but I gave myself time to understand the basics via watching related videos of how MPC functions and its integration with Sharing Schemes and the implementation in real -life scenarios. I was able to successfully understand the workings of the tool and its huge benefit in the field of distributed computing.
