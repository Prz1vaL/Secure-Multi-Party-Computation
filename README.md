Summary of Secure Multi-Party Computation (Secure Multiparty Computation by YEHUDA LINDELL)

Description :

The basis for this summary is the evolution of Secure Multipart
Computation (MPC) from a theoretically based study to a cryptographic technology
after being studied for more than three decades and proving a solid theoretical
foundation. MPC has been utilised in commercial products because it proved to be
effective enough for usage in practice over the last few years. Supplying security and
privacy, particularly for data dispersed across vast, distant networks, is difficult.
Secure Multipart Computation is one method that offers a solution to the issue of
data security and privacy. This essay will summarise MPC's functions, problems,
and position in the technological chain.

Keywords. Secure multiparty computation (with the acronym MPC, and
sometimes SMPC), Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSSs).

Behind the Scenes :

As part of Critical Systems Engineering (CS5032)coursework, the lecturer assigned me this topic as part of the coursework, and it was my responsibility to summarise it based on what I understood from the paper. When I initially looked at it, it seemed like gibberish and was quite complicated, but I gave myself time to learn the fundamentals by viewing films that explained how the MPC works, how it is integrated with sharing schemes, and how it is used in real-world situations. I was able to comprehend the tool's operation and its significant use in the field of distributed computing.
